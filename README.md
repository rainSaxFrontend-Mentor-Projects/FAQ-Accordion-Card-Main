## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest thing I had the opportunity to practice with this project was using CSS Grid for laying out images and overlapping them. Both the mobile and desktop versions had images that laid on top of each other (the orange box, the person at the screen, and the shadow), and CSS Grid provides a way to achieve this without taking elements out of the document flow.

### Continued development

For continued development I would like to refactor some of the html so that the orange box can be out of the overflow:hidden heirarchy and placed properly without having to use position: fixed.

### Useful resources
